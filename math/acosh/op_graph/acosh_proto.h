*@brief Computes inverse hyperbolic cosine of x element-wise.
* Given an input tensor, this function computes inverse hyperbolic cosine for every element in the tensor.
* Input range is [1, inf]. It returns nan if the input lies outside the range.

*
*@par Inputs:
* x: An ND or 5HD tensor. Support 1D~8D. Must be one of the following types:
* float16, float32, float64, complex64, complex128.
*
*@par Outputs:
* y: A tensor. Has the same dtype as "x".
*
*@par Third-party framework compatibility
*Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Acosh.
