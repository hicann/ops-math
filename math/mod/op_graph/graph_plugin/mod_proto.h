/**
* @brief Returns element-wise remainder of division. Support broadcasting operations.

* @par Inputs:
* Two inputs, including:
* @li x1: A ND tensor. Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32,
* int32, int64, int8, uint8, double.
* @li x2: A ND tensor of the same dtype as "x1". \n

* @par Outputs:
* y: A ND tensor. Has the same dtype as "x1". \n

* @attention Constraints:
* @li x2: The input data does not support 0.
* @li When NUM exceeds 2048 , the accuracy of operator cannot guarantee the
* requirement of double thousandths in the mini form.
* @li Due to different architectures, the calculation results of this operator
* on NPU and CPU may be inconsistent.
* @li If shape is expressed as (D1,D2... ,Dn),
* then D1*D2... *DN<=1000000,n<=8. \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility:
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Mod.
