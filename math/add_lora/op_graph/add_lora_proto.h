/**
* @brief AddLora, the operation kernel for batch gather matmul.
* @par Inputs:
* @li y: A tensor. Indicates the tensor to be updated by accumulation. The data type is float16. Shape dimension is 2D:
[B, H3].
* Supported format "ND". The first dimension needs to be consistent with the first dimension of x, both represented by
B.
* @li x: A tensor. Input tensor before grouping. Data type supports float16. Shape dimension is 2D: [B, H1],
* where H1 is a multiple of 16. Supported format "ND".
* @li weightB: A weight tensor of type float16. Supported format "ND". Represents the second weight matrix for matrix
multiplication.
* Shape dimension is 4D: [W, L, H2, R]. The third dimension needs to be smaller than the second dimension of y (H2<H3),
* and H2 is an integer multiple of 16.
* @li indices: A tensor. Indicates the group index of the input x. The data type is int32. Shape dimension is 1D: [B],
* which must be the same as the first dimension of x and y. Both of them are represented by B. Supported format "ND".
* @li weightA: A optional weight tensor of type float16. Indicates the first weight matrix for matrix multiplication.
* If the value is null, the first matrix multiplication is skipped.
* Shape dimension is 4D: [W, L, R, H1]. The first two dimensions must be consistent with the first two dimensions of
weightB,
* which are represented by W and L. The third dimension must be consistent with the fourth dimension of weightB,
* and both dimensions are represented by R. The fourth dimension must be the same as the second dimension of x,
* both are represented by H1, and must be an integer multiple of 16. Supported format "ND".

* @par Attributes:
* @li layer_idx: A optional int, default value is 0, indicates the layer id of weight tensors.
* The value must be less than the second dimension L of weightB.
* @li scale: A optional float, default value is 1e-3, scales up the multiplication results.
* @li y_offset: A optional int, default value is 0,  represents the offset of y.
* The value needs to be less than the second dimension H3 of y.
* @li y_slice_size: A optional int, default value is -1, represents the slice_size of y to be updated.
* The value needs to be less than the second dimension H3 of y.

* @par Outputs:
* y_out: A tensor of type float16, the shape requirements are consistent with the shape of y.
* The shape dimension is two dimensions. Supported format "ND". Has the same as type as y.
