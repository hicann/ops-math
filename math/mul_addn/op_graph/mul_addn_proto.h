 *@brief Confuse broadcast, addn and n mul operation. Support broadcasting operations.
 *@par Inputs:
*Two inputs, including:
* @li x1: A ND tensor. Must be one of the following types:bfloat16 float16, float32.
* @li x2: A ND tensor of the same dtype as "x1". \n

*@par Outputs:
*@ y: A ND tensor. Has the same dtype as "x1". \n

*@par Attributes:
* N:Represent the number of fusion mul operations, which is grater than or equal to 2.
    The support type is the int.

* @attention Constraints:
* @li The third dimension of x1 and the second dimension of x2 are both 1.
* @li The third dimension of x2 must be less than or equal to 2040.
