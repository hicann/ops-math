/**
*@brief Counts the number of occurrences of each value in an integer array.
Outputs a vector with length size and the same dtype as weights. If weights
are empty, then index i stores the number of times the value i is counted in
arr. If weights are non-empty, then index i stores the sum of the value in
weights at each index.

*@par Inputs:
*The input size must be a non-negative int32 scalar Tensor. Inputs include:
*@li array:int32 Tensor.
*@li size:non-negative int32 scalar Tensor.
*@li weights: is an int32, int64, float32, or double Tensor with the same
shape as arr, or a length-0 Tensor, in which case it acts as all weights
equal to 1. \n

*@par Outputs:
*bins:1D Tensor with length equal to size. The counts or summed weights for
each value in the range [0, size). \n

*@par Third-party framework compatibility
*Compatible with tensorflow Bincount operator.
