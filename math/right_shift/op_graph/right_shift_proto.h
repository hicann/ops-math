/**
*@brief Element-wise computes the bitwise right-shift of x and y . \n

*@par Inputs:
*Input "x" is a k-dimensional tensor. Inputs "num_lower" and "num_upper"
are 0D scalars.
* @li x: A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int8, int16, int32,
int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64.
* @li y: A Tensor. Has the same type as "x".  \n

*@par Outputs:
* z: A Tensor. Has the same type as "x".  \n

*@attention Constraints:
*Unique runs on the Ascend AI CPU, which delivers poor performance.  \n

*@par Third-party framework compatibility
*Compatible with the TensorFlow operator RightShift.
