/**
*@brief Computes the "logical or" of elements across dimensions of a tensor.
* Reduces "x" along the dimensions given in "axes".
* Unless "keep_dims" is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each
* entry in "axes". If "keep_dims" is true, the reduced dimensions
* are retained with length 1.
*
* If "axes" is None, all dimensions are reduced, and a
* tensor with a single element is returned.
*
*@attention Constraints:
* Only support bool
*
*@par Inputs:
*@li x : The boolean tensor to reduce.
*@li axes: The int tensor, The dimensions to reduce.
*          If "None" (default), reduces all dimensions.
*          Must be in the range "[-rank(x), rank(x))".
*@par Attributes:
* keep_dims: bool, default false.
*If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.
*
*@par Outputs:
* y: The reduced tensor
*
*@par Third-party framework compatibility
*Compatible with the TensorFlow operator reduce_any.
