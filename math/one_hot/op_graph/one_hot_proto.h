/**
* @brief Returns a one-hot tensor. The locations represented by index in "x" take value "on_value",
*         while all other locations take value "off_value" .

* @par Inputs:
* Four inputs, including:
* @li x: A 1-7D tensor of indices, format supports ND, and data type must be one of the following types: int32, uint8, int64.
* @li depth: A scalar which is the depth of the one hot dimension, format supports ND, and data type must be int32 or int64
*     Its shape can be 1-8D, but only the first element make sense.
* @li on_value: A scalar. The value to fill in output when indices[j] = i, format supports ND.
*     Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, int64, int32, int8, uint8.
*     Its shape can be 1-8D, but only the first element make sense.
* @li off_value: A scalar. The value to fill in output when indices[j] != i, format supports ND.
*     Has the same type as "on_value". Its shape can be 1-8D, but only the first element make sense.

* @par Attributes:
* axis: The axis to fill. An int with a minimum value of -1 and a maximum value of dims of x. Defaults to "-1"

* @par Outputs:
* y: A 1-8D tensor. Has the same type as "on_value" . \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility:
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator OneHot.
