*@brief Returns (x1 - x2)(x1 - x2) element-wise. Support broadcasting operations.

*@par Inputs:
*Two inputs, including: \n
*@li x1: A ND Tensor. Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32,
* float64, int32, int64, complex64, complex128.
*@li x2: A ND Tensor. Has the same dtype as "x1".
* The shape of x1 and x2 must meet the requirements of the broadcast relationship. \n

*@par Outputs:
*y: A ND Tensor. Has the same dtype as "x1". \n

*@par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with TensorFlow operator SquaredDifference.
