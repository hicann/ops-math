/**
*@brief Updates "ref" by assigning "value" to it. Donot support broadcasting operations.

*@par Inputs:
* @li ref: A ND Tensor. Support 1D ~ 8D. Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32,
*    double, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64,
*    complex64, complex128, qint8, quint8, qint16, qint32, quint16, bool, string.
*    Support format list: ["NC1HWC0", "ND", "C1HWNCoC0", "FRACTAL_Z", "FRACTAL_Z_3D",
*    "NDC1HWC0", "FRACTAL_NZ"].
*@li value: A ND Tensor of the same shape and dtype and format as "ref". \n

*@par Attributes:
*@li validate_shape: An optional bool. Defaults to "true".
                     If "true", the operation will validate that the shape of "value" matches the shape of the Tensor being assigned to.
*                    If "false", "ref" will take on the shape of "value".
*                    This attribute is reserved.
*@li use_locking: An optional bool. Defaults to false.
                  If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock;
                  otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.
*                 This attribute is reserved. \n

*@par Outputs:
*ref: A ND Tensor that holds the new value of ref after the value has been assigned.
*Has the same shape and dtype and format as the input "ref". \n

*@par Third-party framework compatibility
*Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Assign.
