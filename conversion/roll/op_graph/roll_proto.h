/**
*@brief Roll the tensor along the given dimension(s).
* Elements that are shifted beyond the last position are re-introduced at the first position.
* If a dimension is not specified, the tensor will be flattened before rolling and then restored to the original shape.

*@par Inputs:
*One input, including:
* x: A tensor. Must be one of the following types:
*     float16, bfloat16, float32, int32, uint32, int8, uint8, int64. \n

*@par Attributes:
* @li shifts: A required listInt. The number of places by which the elements of the tensor are shifted. 
*      The length of the array must be equal to dims, but if dims is empty, the array must be one-dimensional. \n
* @li dims: An optional listInt. Defaults to "None". Axis along which to roll. The value of the range is [0, number of dimensions for input -1] or [-number of dimensions for self, -1].


*@par Outputs:
* y: A Tensor with the same type and shape of x. \n

*@par Third-party framework compatibility
*Compatible with the Pytorch operator Roll. \n
