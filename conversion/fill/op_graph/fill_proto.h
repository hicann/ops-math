/**
* @brief Creates a tensor filled with a scalar value.
* This operation creates a tensor of shape "dims" and fills it with "value".
*
* @par Inputs:
* @li dims: A 1D tensor of types int32 or int64. Represents the shape of the output tensor .
        The size of each dimension must be less than or equal to 8. \n

* @li value: A 0D scalar. Specifies the value to fill the returned tensor.
*    Must be one of the following types:
*    bfloat16, float16, float32, double, int32, uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, bool,
*    qint8, quint8, qint32, qint16, quint16, uint16, complex128, uint32, uint64, string.
*
* @par Outputs:
* y: A tensor. Has the same type as "value".
*
* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* @li Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Fill.
* @li Compatible with the Caffe operator Filler.
