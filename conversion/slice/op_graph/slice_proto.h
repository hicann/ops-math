/**
* @brief Extracts a slice from a tensor.
*       This operation extracts a slice of size "size" from a tensor "x"
*       starting at the location specified by "offsets".

* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A Tensor. Must be one of the following types:
* bfloat16, float16, float32, double, int64, int32, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int8,
* int16, complex64, complex128, qint8, quint8, qint16, quint16, qint32, hifloat8, float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn.
* @li offsets: A Tensor of type int32 or int64. The starting location for the slice.
* @li size: A Tensor of type int32 or int64. The tensor size for the slice. \n

* @attention Constraints:
* @li 0 <= offset[i] <= offset[i] + size[i] <= x_dim[i] for i in [0,n],
* n is the dimension of the tensor "x". \n
* @li offsets, size and x must have the same rank.

* @par Outputs:
* y: A Tensor. Has the same type as "x". The slice extracted from the tensor. \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Slice.
