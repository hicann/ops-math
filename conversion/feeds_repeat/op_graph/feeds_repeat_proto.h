/**
* @brief Repeat every row of input 'feeds' different times with padding in the end.
* @par Inputs:
* Two inputs:
* @li feeds: A Tensor with ND format. Only support float, float16, bfloat16 for now. Other types include int8, int16,
int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, bool will be supported later.
* @li feeds_repeat_times: A Tensor with ND format. Support int32, int64. Describe repeat times for every row of input
'feeds'.

* @par Attributes:
* output_feeds_size: An required int, specifying the dim0 of y, describing padding space.

* @par Outputs:
* y: A Tensor, which is the same dtype as feeds. Dim0 is output_feeds_size, other dims are same as feeds.

* @attention Constraints:
* @li The length of feeds_repeat_times must be same as feeds' dim0 size.
* @li The byte of feeds_repeat_times cannot reach about 64KB.
