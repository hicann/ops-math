/**
 * @brief Broadcasts an array for a compatible shape.
 *  Broadcasting is the process of making arrays to have compatible shapes
 *  for arithmetic operations. Two shapes are compatible if for each
 *  dimension pair they are either equal or one of them is one. When trying
 *  to broadcast a Tensor to a shape, it starts with the trailing dimensions,
 *  and works its way forward.
 *
 * @par Inputs:
 * @li x: A tensor, support all dtype include(BasicType, bool, string, hifloat8, float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn).
 * @li shape: A tensor.
 *     A 1D tensor of type int32 or int64, for the shape of the desired output.
 *
 * @par Outputs:
 * y: A tensor. Has the same tensor info of "x".
 *
 * @par Third-party framework compatibility
 * Compatible with the TensorFlow operator BroadcastTo.
